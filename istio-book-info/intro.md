# Istio Book Info Debugging

In this scenario you will have access to a running Kubernetes cluster with an application called `book-info`  deployed to it.

`book-info` is an example microservice application made by Istio that is meant to showcase service mesh features. This app has four different services within it:  products, details, ratings, and reviews. Each of these services handles one part of the platform.

The version of `book-info`  which is deployed to this scenario is broken - **Figure out why the service isn't responding and fix it**
You may download tools to help you solve the issue and feel free to Google things as you debug.
